# tiny-graphics-js

This is a small, single file JavaScript utility for organizing WebGL programs to be object-oriented and minimally cluttered.  This tiny library gives your WebGL program access to linear algebra routines, useful UI controls and readouts, and the drawing utilities needed by modern shader-based graphics.  It factors away the repetitive logic of GPU communication into re-usable objects.

The tiny-graphics.js software library has accompanied UCLA Computer Science's 174a course (Intro to Computer Graphics) since 2016, replacing Edward Angel's supplemental code from his textbook "Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with WebGL".  Compared to Angel's library, tiny-graphics.js offers improved educational utility, organization, functionality, and performance.

This code library accompanies and supports a web project by the same author called "The Encyclopedia of Code", a crowd-sourced repository of WebGL demos and educational tutorials that uses an online editor.  It consists of one unified codebase, serving as both a game engine and an encyclopedia.

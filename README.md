# Titanic Panic!

A CS 174A tiny-graphics project. <br />
Made by Ben, Estee, Josh, and Stephanie.

It’s 1912. Your time machine was successful and you’ve transported on to the Titanic’s maiden voyage, minutes before the infamous crash. Knowing Titanic’s fate, can you change the course of history and steer her to safety?

Using the  ←  and  →  keys, you can steer the boat from left to right and avoid oncoming iceberg obstacles. The deeper you go, the more difficult the icebergs become to avoid.

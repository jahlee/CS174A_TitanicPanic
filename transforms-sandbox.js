Google "es6" instead of "JavaScript" when learning to avoid missing newer capabilities.  Generally, you'll want to get comfortable with imperative, object oriented, and functional programming styles to use this library.   
      </p><p>This first article is meant to show how best to organize a 3D graphics program in JavaScript using WebGL -- a \"hello world\" example, or more accurately, \"hello triangle\". A lot of \"boilerplate\" code is required just to get a single 3D triangle to draw on a web canvas, and it's not at all obvious how to organize that code so that you can be flexible later, when you'll probably want to dynamically switch out pieces of your program whenever you want - whether they be other shader programs, vertex arrays (shapes), textures (images), or entire scenes. You might even want those things to happen whenever the user of your program presses a button.    
      </p><p>This \"hello triangle\" example is organized to do all that while keeping its source code tiny. A ~500 line library file called tiny-graphics.js sets up all the flexibility mentioned above, and it's shared by all pages on this encyclopedia.  That file can always be accessed <a href=/tiny-graphics.js>here</a>.  A file called dependencies.js contains all the code required by the particular article you're viewing on the encyclopedia of code. Every article you navigate to on the encyclopedia will provide you with a minimal copy of dependencies.js, containing only the code that your current article needs.    
      </p><p>If you have never written a graphics program before, you'll need to know what a transformation matrix is in 3D graphics. Check out <a href=https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/j855t03rsfv1cn/j9k7wl8ijmks0 target='_blank'>this other .pdf document</a> explaining those, including the three special matrices (rotation, translation, and scale) that you'll see over and over in graphics programs like this one. Finally, scroll down to the source code at the bottom to see how these functions are used to generate special matrices that draw the shapes in the right places in the 3D world.    
      </p><p>The scene shown here demonstrates a lot of concepts at once using very little code.  These include drawing your first triangle, storing trivial shapes, storing lights and materials and shader programs, flat vs. smooth shading, and matrix transformations.   You can see all the parts of the scene being drawn by the code written in the "display" function; these parts are all independent from one another, so feel free delete whichever sections you want from there and the other shapes will remain.
